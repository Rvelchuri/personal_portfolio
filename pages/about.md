My name is Rajani Velchuri, and I'd like to introduce myself. I went back to school to get my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications engineering. In India, I worked as an Associate and assistant professor in an engineering college. After getting married, I moved to the United States and worked for two years as a Quality assurance analyst. To care for twins, I took a long vacation from my profession. Now that they're nine years old, they don't expect much from me, so I'm reconsidering my decision to pursue a job in software development.

In the part of getting into software field, got the Bootcamp opportunity through Hackbright Academy under Women empowerment sponsored by Target.learned new software skills from bootcamp like object oriented programmin in python, how to use Github(forking, pushing, cloning , creating repositories), mock interviews. Finally landed in Target as EEP Intern.
