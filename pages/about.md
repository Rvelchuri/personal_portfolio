My name is Rajani Velchuri, and I'd like to introduce myself. I went back to school to get my bachelor's degree in electronics and communications engineering. In India, I worked as an associate and assistant professor in an engineering college. After getting married, I moved to the United States and worked for two years as a quality assurance analyst. To care for twins, I took a long vacation from my profession. Now that they're nine years old, they don't expect much from me, so I'm reconsidering my decision to pursue a job in software development.
